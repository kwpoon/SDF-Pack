### Introduction
This repository is for our IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2023 paper *'SDF-Pack: Towards Compact Bin Packing with Signed-Distance-Field Minimization'*. In this paper, we present a novel packing method named SDF-Pack which leverages the truncated signed distance field to model the containerâ€™s geometric condition. We also developed the SDF-minimization heuristic to effectively evaluate spatial compactness and find compact object placements.

*The current version contains the key implementation for the signed distance field (SDF) construction given the container's top-down heightmap and that of the SDF-Minimization packing heuristics. We are still updating the repository.*

### Dataset Preparation
We performed experiments on 1000 packing sequences of 96 types of objects collected from the YCB dataset and the Rutgers APC RGB-D dataset. Please download the processed dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i2iPqhWSmGWMJC3wa9Y_fVD3HyuklFAO/view?usp=sharing) and extract the files in the folder `./dataset/`. The object IDs forming the packing sequences can be found at `1000_packing_sequences_of_80_objects.npy`.
```

|   |   |-- 00002777_cheezit_big_original-processed_depth.npy
|   |   |...
```
The subfolder `./dataset/our_oriented_dataset/` contains the object meshes that are simplified and processed to be watertight. These meshes are further processed through V-HACD convex decomposition for collision simulation, and the processed collision models are presented in the folder `./dataset/our_oriented_decomp/`. We also provide the voxelization results of the objects in `./dataset/our_oriented_occs/`. 

### Key Implementation
Our key implementation of the GPU-based SDF construction and the SDF-Minimization packing heuristics can be found at `v11_heuristic_packing.py`.

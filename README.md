### Introduction
This repository is for our IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2023 paper 'SDF-Pack: Towards Compact Bin Packing with Signed-Distance-Field Minimization'. In this paper, we present a novel framework named SDF-Pack to enhance robotic bin packing. Our method leverages the truncated signed distance field to model the containerâ€™s geometric condition and the SDF-minimization heuristic to effectively assess the spatial compactness and find compact object placements. 

Codes coming soon.

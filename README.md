### Introduction
This repository is for our IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2023 paper 'SDF-Pack: Towards Compact Bin Packing with Signed-Distance-Field Minimization'. In this paper, we present a novel packing method named SDF-Pack which leverages the truncated signed distance field to model the containerâ€™s geometric condition. We also developed the SDF-minimization heuristic to effectively evaluate spatial compactness and find compact object placements.

This repository contains the key codes for constructing the signed distance field (SDF) based on the container's top-down heightmap, the key implementation of the SDF-Minimization packing heuristics, and we keep updating it.
